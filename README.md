# Moneypool
An app that keeps a track of all your friends to whom you've either lended or borrowed money to/from.
As engineers face amnesia everyday and especially when it comes to friends' money therefore we decided to tackle this predicament. Moneypool allows anyone to remember to/from whom they either lended or borrowed money.
The only prerequisite is internet connection in your phones. Just by clicking lend/borrow buttons, required amount is added to their name and you can track all those users.
Keep in mind that no real transaction occurs. It is just a utility to allow to you remember and track all your debits/credits.
